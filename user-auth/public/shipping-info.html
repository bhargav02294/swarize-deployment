        <h1>Your Guide to Smooth and Timely Deliveries with Swarize</h1>

<section class="container">

    <h2> Two Shipping Methods</h2>
    <p>At Swarize, sellers have the flexibility to choose between two shipping options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Seller Ships Directly:</strong> The seller handles packaging and shipping. The estimated delivery time is faster since the seller ships the product directly.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Swarize Fulfillment:</strong> If the seller does not have the product in stock, Swarize sources it from other suppliers and handles the shipping. This may take slightly longer but ensures product availability.</li>
    </ul>

</section>





        <h2>3. Order Tracking</h2>
        <p>Once your order is shipped, you will receive an email and SMS with a tracking ID. You can track your order using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Website:</strong> Go to "Collections" in your Swarize account and check</li>
            <li> <strong>SMS & Email:</strong> Tracking details will be sent upon dispatch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Delivery Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Dispatch Time:</strong> Sellers ship orders within <strong>24-48 hours</strong> of order confirmation.</li>
            <li> <strong>Address Accuracy:</strong> Ensure correct shipping details to prevent delays.</li>
            <li> <strong>Signature Requirement:</strong> Some orders may require a signature upon delivery.</li>
            <li> <strong>Note:</strong> Swarize does <strong>not</strong> support <strong>Cash on Delivery (COD)</strong>. All orders must be prepaid.</li>
        </ul>
