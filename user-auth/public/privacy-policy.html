            <h2>Security Measures</h2>
            <p>At Swarize, we prioritize the security of our users’ personal and financial information. To ensure safe transactions, all payments are processed through trusted and encrypted payment gateways like Razorpay. Since we do not support Cash on Delivery (COD), all transactions are prepaid, significantly reducing the risk of fraudulent activities. Additionally, we do not store card details on our servers, ensuring that sensitive payment information remains protected.</p>
            <p>We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to safeguard data during transmission, preventing unauthorized access. User information, including passwords and personal details, is securely stored using encryption techniques. To further enhance security, we encourage users to create strong passwords and avoid sharing their login credentials. In the future, we may introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added protection.</p>
            <p>To prevent fraudulent transactions, Swarize implements automated fraud detection systems that identify suspicious activities. Orders flagged for unusual behavior may require additional verification before processing. Personal data is stored in secured databases with restricted access, ensuring that sensitive information is never shared with third parties except for authorized payment processors. Additionally, we verify sellers before allowing them to list products on our platform, reducing the chances of scams or counterfeit products.</p>
            <p>By implementing these security measures, Swarize ensures a safe, reliable, and trustworthy platform for both buyers and sellers. Protecting user data and transactions is our top priority, and we continuously enhance our security framework to provide a seamless shopping and reselling experience.</p>
