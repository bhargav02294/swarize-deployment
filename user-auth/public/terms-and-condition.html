            <h2>5 Sellerâ€™s Margin and Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Selling your own products on our eCommerce platform gives you full control over pricing and profit margins. Below, we break down how profits are calculated, important policies, and the benefits of selling directly.</p>

<h3>5.1 How Profit is Calculated?</h3>
<p>When you sell a product, your final profit is calculated after deducting platform charges and logistics costs. Here's how the breakdown works:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Selling Price:</strong> This is the price at which the seller lists the product for customers on Swarize. Sellers are free to set their own selling prices within reasonable market rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction Fee:</strong> Swarize charges a commission on each sale based on our tiered transaction fee structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping Fee:</strong> Swarize manages the shipping process entirely, and the shipping fee is deducted from the purchase amount. Charged based on delivery location, weight, and courier rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Profit:</strong> What you earn after all deductions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Important Seller Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sellers must list only genuine and legal products.</li>
    <li>Product images, titles, and descriptions must be accurate.</li>
    <li>Order fulfillment must be done within the promised shipping window.</li>
    <li>ellers must respond to customer inquiries or disputes within 24â€“48 hours.</li>
    <li>Non-compliance may result in penalties, suspension, or delisting..</li>


</ul>

<h3>5.3 Example Calculation:</h3>

        <td>â‚¹120</td>
    </tr>

        <td><strong>Shipping Fee</strong></td>
        <td>â‚¹80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Final Profit</th>
